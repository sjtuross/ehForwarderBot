## FAQ
* **How do I log in to another WeChat Account?**  
  Please remove the `storage/eh_wechat_slave.pkl` file in the EFB root directory, and restart EFB for QR code scanning.
* **Can I log in 2 WeChat accounts concurrently?**  
  No. The feature is not yet available to EWS.
* **How stable is EWS?**  
  EWS relies on the upstream project [ItChat](https://github.com/littlecodersh/ItChat) and WeChat Web protocol. According to [ItChat FAQ](https://itchat.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/FAQ/): the connection can be stable for months, provided you:
  * have a stable internet connection,
  * **keep your WeChat account accessible on a mobile device, (Android, iOS, etc).**

## Known issues
* Random disconnection may occur occasionally due to the limit of protocol.
* Copyright protected sticker sets are not available to Web WeChat, leading to an empty sticker file to be delivered.
* Chat linking may be unstable sometime due to the limit of API.

!!! note "Technical detail"
    WeChat does not provide a stable chat identifier, so hash of the name of a user is used for the chat identifier. This may cause 2 issues:

    * Chat is no longer traceable when its name is changed.
    * Conflict and mis-delivery may happen when 2 users share the same name.


## Experimental flags
The following flags are experimental features, may change, break, or disappear at any time. Use at your own risk.
