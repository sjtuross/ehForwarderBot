* Give read and write access to `eh_telegram_master` directory
* Add variable `eh_telegram_master` as follows

### Start up
No extra action required during start up.

## Supported message types (both directions)
* Text (Link as Text)
* Image
* Sticker
* Document
* Video
* Audio (and Voice)
* Location (and Venue)

## Usage
At the beginning, messages from all senders will be sent to the user directly, that means every message  will be mixed in the same conversation. By linking a chat, you can redirect messages from a specific sender to an empty group for a more organized conversation.

In a nutshell, ETM offers the following commands, you can also send it to BotFather for the command list.

```
help - Show commands list.
link - Link a remote chat to a group.
unlink_all - Unlink all remote chats from a group.
info - Display information of the current Telegram chat.
chat - Generate a chat head.
recog - Recognize a speech by replying to it.
extra - Access extra functionalities.
```

!!! note "Notice"  
    In case of multiple admins are assigned, they may all send message on your behalf, but only the 0th admin can receive direct message from the bot.

### `/link`: Link a chat
1. Create a new group, invite your bot to the group
2. Send `/link` directly to the bot, then select your preferred slave chat.
3. Tap "Link" and select your new group.  
   _You can also choose to unlink or relink a linked chat from this menu._
4. Tap "Start" at the bottom of your screen, and you should see a success message: "Chat associated."

!!! note "Notice"
    You may introduce other non-ETM admins to the group, however, they:

    * Can read all messages send from the related remote chat;
    * May NOT send message on your behalf.

Also, you can send `/unlink_all` to a group to unlink all remote chats from it.

### Send a message
#### Send to a linked chat
You can send message as you do in a normal Telegram chat.

What is supported:

* Send/forward message in all supported types
* Direct reply to a message
* Send message with inline bot in supported types

What is NOT supported:

* @ reference
* Markdown/HTML formatting
* Messages with unsupported types

#### Send to a non-linked chat
To send a message to a non-linked chat, you should "direct reply" to a message or a "chat head" that is sent from your recipient. Those messages should appear only in the bot conversation.

In a non-linked chat, direct reply will not be delivered to the remote channel, everything else is supported as it does in a linked chat.

#### `/chat`: Chat head
If you want to send a message to a non-linked chat which has not yet sent you a message, you can ask ETM to generate a "chat head". Chat head works similarly to an incoming message, you can reply to it to send messages to your recipient.

Send `/chat` to the bot, and choose a chat from the list. When you see "Reply to this message to send to <chat name> from <channel>", it's ready to go.

!!! tip "Advanced feature: Filtering"
    If you have just too much chats, and being too tired for keep tapping `Next >`, or maybe you just want to find a way to filter out what you're looking for, now ETM has equipped `/chat` and `/list` with filtering feature. Attach your keyword behind, and you can get a filtered result.

    E.g.: `/chat Eana` will give you all chats has the word "Eana".

!!! note "Technical Details"
    The filter query is in fact a regular expression matching. We used Python's `re.search` with flags `re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE` in this case, i.e.: `.` matches everything including line breaks, and the query is NOT case-sensitive. Each comparison is done against a specially crafted string which allows you to filter multiple criteria.

        Channel: Dummy Channel
        Name: John Doe
        Alias: Jonny
        ID: john_doe
        Type: User
        Status: Linked

    > _Type can be either "User" or "Group"_  
    > _Status can be empty or either "Linked" or "Muted"_

    Examples:

    * Look for all WeChat groups: `Channel: WeChat.*Type: Group`
    * Look for everyone who has an alias `Name: (.*?)\nAlias: (?!\1)`
    * Look for all entries contain "John" and "Jonny" in any order: `(?=.*John)(?=.*Jonny)"`

### `/extra`: External commands from slave channels ("extra functions")
Some slave channels may provide commands that allows you to remotely control those accounts, and achieve extra functionalities, those commands are called "extra functions". To view the lis of available extra functions, send `/extra` to the bot, you will receive a list of commands available, together with their usages.

Those commands are named like "`/<number>_<command_name>`", and can be called like a Linux/unix CLI utility. (of course, please don't expect piping, etc to be supported)

### `/recog`: Speech recognition
If you have entered a speech recognition service API keys, you can use it to convert speech in voice messages into text.

Reply any voice messages in a conversation with the bot, with the command `/recog`, and the bot will try to convert it to text using those speech recognition services enabled.

If you know the language used in this message, you can also attach the language code to the command for a more precise conversion.

## Known issues
* In rare cases, some messages may take 20 to 35 minutes to be delivered to user. (Upstream library [python-telegram-bot#364](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/issues/364), said to be fixed in version 6.)
* Too often invitation of the bot to groups will trigger Telegram's anti-spam mechanism. If you see "Could not add user, please try again later", you really need to "try again later". No joking.
